# Plot Party Day 2

## Prompt: No Paper
Description from the plot party website:
> June 13 – No Paper
>
> It’s easy to slam down a piece of paper and get plotting, but what if you chose not to? What if you chose wood, water, paint, metal or anything else you can dream up?! As long as it is not paper!

## Design

I decided to try paint pens on wood. I got a blank 10' x 10' wood panel from Michael's and
some Posca paint pens. The design is a 5 generation [Gosper Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosper_curve)
(or 4 depending on how you count, this design counts the initial line as generation 1). The curve is
implemented with a [Lindenmayer system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system).

The user can vary the number of generations, line thickness in mm, step size in mm, and starting point
for the curve. Here is a screenshot of the UI:

I experimented with 2 colors, dark blue and white, with one color as a sort of "drop shadow". With the
color of the wood I dediced to go with the dark blue on the bottom, which made the curve look
like it's floating on top of the wood.

## Results

It was a little tricky to line up the panel so that the design would be centered. It was
also the first time I used paint pens, so I did a couple of test runs with cardstock on
top of the panel so I could get the right speed and gap above the wood.

Here is a picture of the final result:
