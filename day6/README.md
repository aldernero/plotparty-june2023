# Plot Party Day 6

## Prompt: Postcard Exchange
Description from the plot party website:
> June 17 â€“ Postcard Exchange
>
> A postcard sized prompt, make any small, postcard sized work.

## Design

The design was a combination of the circle design from [Day 5](../day5/README.md) and the following
Desmos trochoid design: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ucabzcwchx

There was no specific code for this one.

I started playing with trochoids to see if they would make a good basis for the Day 4 "Water" prompt, but
ended up going with a different design. These made a good background for the postcards.

## Results

I plotted both the front and back of 4x6 cardstock. Here is an example:
