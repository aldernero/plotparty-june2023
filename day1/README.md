# Plot Party Day 1

## Prompt: Portrait
Description from the plot party website:
> June 12 – Portrait
> 
> A thematic opener for this year’s Plot Party! Will you draw yourself, a friend, your beloved pet? Or take things in a more abstract direction?!

## Design

The design consists of a configurable number of lines. Each line is a sine wave, and the amplitude of
the wave varies according to the luminosity of the pixel at a given point in the photo. The user can
vary the number of lines, points per line, frequency, amplitude, and line thickness. Here is a screenshot 
of the interactive UI:

## Results

Overall the resulting details are good enough to represent the photo. However, the portrait is more recognizable
the farther away you are from it. Here is a photo of a finished plot.
