# Plot Party Day 3

## Prompt: Symmetry
Description from the plot party website:
> June 14 â€“ Symmetry
>
> Anything with some symmetry is all you need! Think repetition, mandalas, spirals, etc.

## Design

This is my favorite so far because the design is very simple, but the results are varied, complex, and
beautiful. The design starts with a regular polygon in the center. Then, there are two recursive paths.
The first recurses into the center of the polygon, drawing a new one with a given scale factor and rotation.
The second recurses into each of the vertices of the polygon. The scale factors, rotations, and number of
recursions to skip for the vetrices (to avoid becoming to busy) are changeable via sliders. Here is a 
screenshot of the UI:

## Results

By setting the outer skip in the range of 3-4, recursion to 10-15, and playing with the inner and outer
scales, one can create some interesting looking fractal spirals. Below are some examples:
