# Plot Party Day 5

## Prompt: Circles
Description from the plot party website:
> June 16 â€“ Circles
>
> Show us your best work celebrating that most beautiful curvy infinite geometric form we all know and love: the circle!

## Design

This was similar in spirit to Day 3 "Symmetry", in that it was a simple, recursive design that leads to 
complex and sometimes surprising results.

One starts with a circle in the center. From each circle, 3 more are created, each with its own angle relative
to the parent circle, angle difference, and scale factor. The user can also change the depth, and a minimum
radius, which will skip any circles that would be smaller than the minimum. The circles can be filled or
transparent. Here is a screenshot of the UI:
